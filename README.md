# Python-PostScript-Interpreter

## Project Overview

### General Description/Motivation

This project implemented a Simple PostScript interpreter using Python. The project aimed to practice the understanding of how interpeters work and how languages that use postfix notation work by implementing it. This project also focused on languages that use static scoping vs dynamic scoping by implementing the PostScript interpeter using both scoping methods. This project was an assignment I did in my progamming language design class. 

## Installation

  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Quick Start

  - Clone Repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/joshua-frey-wsu/Python-PostScript-Interpreter.git
    ```
  - To run interactive environment of the simple PostScript interpreter enter the     
    following commmand:
    ```python3 repl.py```
  - Then play around and type postscript commands and use stack to see the dictionary 
    and operand stack.

## Usage 

  - To run the test cases type the following command:
    ```
    python -m unittest -v tests_part2.py
    ```
